# natural-log
An e-log book for DPS South

The objective of this project is to replace all physical log books
with a computerised book. Teachers use log books to track what they
have taught in each class, every day. They enter data into a book, 
filling up pages of it every year, and making it almost impossible
to check if a topic has been covered.
